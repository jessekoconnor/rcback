RoleCall App

=========================================


Runs on heroku.


To run locally:

You need to install mysql just like in our production environment (http://postgresapp.com/)
    - all you need to do is download and run it. Make sure to make the $PATH change step in installation.
      $PATH is the path gives your command line quick access to commands. (ex: it allows us to tpe "curl" versus "/usr/bin/curl")


	1. heroku local start
	2. You need mysql going too. Heres what you need to do after you log into mysql as root:
	    CREATE DATABASE rollcall;
	    USE rollcall;
	    CREATE TABLE users;
	    CREATE USER 'rollcall'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'treestump';
	    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'rollcall'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

Endpoints: (just run 'curl localhost:5000' + endpoint to hit it from the command line while its running locally)
    /getAllFriends
        - queries for all the users in the database
    /saveUser
        - saves a user into the database


    /mockFriends
        - returns a mock friends array
    /cool
        - returns a cool persons face

Examples:
    save a user in the database
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"name":"jesse wiz", "schedule":"free", "mood":"happy"}' http://localhost:5000/saveUser

    return all the users in the database
        curl localhost:5000/getAllFriends

    return a smiley face
        curl localhost:5000/cool
