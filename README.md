##To run locally:

You need to install mysql just like in our production environment (http://postgresapp.com/)
    - all you need to do is download and run it. Make sure to make the $PATH change step in installation.
      $PATH is the path gives your command line quick access to commands. (ex: it allows us to tpe "curl" versus "/usr/bin/curl")
